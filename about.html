      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        I am a Computer Science student with a keen interest in web development, UI/UX design
        and data analytics. I enjoy building small projects that solve real problems and improve
        user experience. During college, I participate in hackathons and collaborative projects
        to sharpen my practical skills and network with peers and mentors.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        I believe in learning by doing, and I am continuously exploring new technologies
        such as React, Python for data science, and modern CSS techniques. Outside academics,
        I like photography, contributing to open-source projects, and after all this cars are what make me what I am, Cars are the thing about which i am the most passionate.
